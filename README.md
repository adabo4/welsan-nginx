# WELSAN English School Website

I created this website using React library. It is made of two parts. React app is in the client folder and the server folder contains the build. I made it like this because I wanted to run a newsletter service and it required to use an API with CRUD operations. 

## Features

- Main Slider of images which move every four seconds and when clicked on arrows. 
- Dropdown menu.
- Responsive design.
- Email validation in the form. 
- EmailJS service for sending emails.
- Convertkit API service for delivering newsletters to subscribers. 

## What I learned

- How to validate forms properly to get correct data from the user.
- How to configure nginx on virtual private server to host the website content.
- How to make navigation appear as hamburger menu on the smaller resolution screens.
